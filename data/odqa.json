After discovering Barry is the Flash , the prison 's warden , Gregory Wolfe , locks Barry in his private metahuman wing , intending to sell him to Amunet . 82 13 `` True Colors '' Tara Nicole Weyr Jonathan Butler & Gabriel Garza February 6 , 2018 ( 2018 - 02 - 06 ) T27. 13413 2.28 Wolfe plans to sell Barry and the imprisoned bus metas ( Ramsey Deacon , Becky Sharpe , Mina Chaytan , and Sylbert Rundine ) to Amunet , so they plan to escape . Cecile discovers Wolfe 's plans after reading his mind . Ralph encounters a former colleague and his negative interaction with him prompts the discovery that he can shapeshift . His lack of mastery of the new ability prevents his attempt to foil Amunet 's deal with Wolfe . Barry helps the metas escape the power dampeners , but they are cornered by Wolfe and Amunet . DeVoe arrives and again uses his chair to extract the metas ' abilities , before transferring his mind into Sharpe 's body . He then crushes Wolfe 's skull as Marlize looks on in horror ; Amunet flees . Ralph uses his shapeshifting ability to appear as the original DeVoe at Barry 's appeal , claiming that he was unconscious at Barry 's loft but not dead , which clears Barry 's name . Team Flash realizes that DeVoe is only stealing powers from metahumans who were on the bus when the dark matter wave was unleashed , which means he will likely target Ralph as well . Back at the DeVoes ' house , their marriage continues to deteriorate , and DeVoe drugs his wife with the Weeper 's tears to maintain her devotion towards him . 83 14 `` Subject 9 '' Ralph Hemecker Mike Alber & Gabe Snyder February 27 , 2018 ( 2018 - 02 - 27 ) T27. 13414 2.12 Barry is put on indefinite leave at the CCPD due to his connection with the DeVoe case . The team encounter another bus metahuman named Izzy with sound wave abilities , amplified by her violin . She manages to use her abilities when DeVoe ( inside Sharpe 's body ) comes to claim her . Barry and Ralph help to train Izzy to refine her abilities , which proves difficult when she gets hurt . Eventually DeVoe shows up once again , using Dominic 's and Becky 's abilities to make Barry experience a brain aneurysm , while using Rundine 's abilities to incapacitate Ralph . DeVoe then once again uses the chair to transfer his mind into Izzy 's body and escapes . Both Ralph and Barry comfort each other over their respective losses : Barry being let go from the police force and Ralph losing Izzy to DeVoe . These losses enforce both Barry 's and Ralph 's determination to bring DeVoe down and save the three remaining metas . 84 15 `` Enter Flashtime '' Gregory Smith Todd Helbing & Sterling Gates March 6 , 2018 ( 2018 - 03 - 06 ) T27. 13415 2.04 Jesse comes to Earth - 1 to have a talk with her dad . Eco-terrorist Veronica Dale sets off a nuclear bomb , which Barry tries to stop , entering a form of superspeed known as Flashtime , where everything is frozen . However , the bomb has already detonated , and he and Jesse can not stop it or save everyone with superspeed . Jay Garrick comes from Earth - 3 to help , but they are still unable to stop it . Barry remains in Flashtime for hours , bringing each of his friends into it , in an attempt to find a solution ; they discuss options such as freezing it or sending it to another Earth , but none of those solutions prove to be viable . Eventually , Iris gives him the idea to retrieve the Quark Sphere from the Speed Force to send a blast lightning through the bomb , enough to disable it . Barry does so , and throws the Sphere back into the Speed Force , saving Central City . Jay admits he is retiring and going to train a new `` female '' speedster . Jesse and Jay return to their Earths , and Caitlin and Wells go for a coffee , where they encounter the mysterious girl . 85 16 `` Run , Iris , Run '' Harry Jierjian Eric Wallace March 13 , 2018 ( 2018 - 03 - 13 ) T27. 13416 2.09 A metahuman with fire powers tries to rob Central City bank . Another bus meta named Matthew Kim touches the metahuman , which causes his powers to transfer to another individual . When Joe , Iris and Barry turn up to ask Kim a few questions , Barry and Iris come into contact with Kim , causing Barry to lose his speed and Iris to gain superspeed . Inspired by Thawne , Harry plans to build his own thinking cap to outwit DeVoe . With their roles reversed , Iris becomes Central City 's hero speedster , while Barry must learn to act as team leader . The new metahuman demands money and terrorizes the city with his fire powers . Using Wells ' thinking cap , the Team comes up with the idea for Iris to create a tidal wave , negating the flames and defeating the meta . Back at S.T.A.R. Labs , Kim touches Iris and Barry again , restoring the Flash 's speed . At home , Iris admits that while she did enjoy having superspeed , Central City needs the light that Barry was , and she is happy being team leader . Wells uses his thinking cap once more , determining the final two bus metas are Janet Petty and Edwin Gauss . 86 17 `` Null and Annoyed '' Kevin Smith Lauren Certo & Kristen Kim April 10 , 2018 ( 2018 - 04 - 10 ) T27. 13417 1.82 Barry and Ralph train to defeat DeVoe , with Barry becoming annoyed at Ralph 's apparent inability to be serious . The team manages to locate another bus meta , Janet Petty . When Barry and Ralph confront her , it is revealed that Petty can manipulate a person 's gravitational pull , which she demonstrates on Barry . Fearing once again that Ralph is not taking things seriously , Barry refuses to work with him . Ralph reveals his comedic attitude is due to a difficult childhood where his father abandoned him , causing him to make jokes whenever he is scared or under pressure . Barry relents and they go to stop Janet at a gala event . Janet uses her powers on Barry , causing him to float into the atmosphere . Barry tells the team to trust Ralph to improvise . Ralph detains Janet , then becomes a giant airbag to allow Barry to land safely . DeVoe 's wife discovers he has been drugging her , so she will continue to assist him . Breacher comes to Earth - 1 to ask Cisco for help as some of his powers have failed . Harry takes the thinking cap to Thawne 's time vault to recharge it and activates Gideon . 87 18 `` Lose Yourself '' Hanelle Culpepper Jonathan Butler & Gabriel Garza April 17 , 2018 ( 2018 - 04 - 17 ) T27. 13418 1.88 Team Flash track down the final bus meta Edwin Gauss , but are followed by the Samuroid , who injures Caitlin . The team rush back to Star Labs to regroup and heal . Caitlin reveals to Iris that Killer Frost is activated by her adrenal gland , and she is working on a way to separate them . Harry comes up with a tuning fork weapon that mimics Izzy 's abilities in order to defeat DeVoe . Ralph reveals to Barry that he is n't afraid of losing his own life , but of Team Flash losing theirs , as he considers them family . Wells is shown to be addicted to the Thinking Cap , which Joe helps him deal with . Ralph takes the fork , with the intent to go with Edwin to kill DeVoe , which Barry argues against . Eventually , DeVoe manages to take over Edwin 's mind , and as well takes the abilities of Janet Petty and Matthew Kim , before transferring his mind into Ralph 's body . The team try to stop him , but DeVoe incapacitates them , and alters Caitlin 's DNA , removing the dark matter and Killer Frost , before leaving . Back at his lair , DeVoe uses Ralph 's morphing abilities to morph back into his original form , while he and Marlize plan their next move to destroy Team Flash . 88 19 `` Fury Rogue '' Rachel Talalay Joshua V.

Barry and Cisco travel to Earth X to recruit Leo Snart as a backup , but are followed to Earth 1 by the Earth X doppelganger of Laurel Lance . Team Flash plan to deliver Borman to a safe ARGUS facility , using a suit to contain the radiation , with Snart on hand , in case Borman goes nuclear . Snart agrees to help , but claims he can only stay for 24 hours , as he is due to get married to Ray Terrill . DeVoe attempts to intercept the transfer , but he and Team Flash are further ambushed by Earth X Laurel , who kidnaps Caitlin , Borman and Joe , holding them at CCPD . Snart learns about Ralph , and convinces Barry to allow himself to grieve his fallen allies , which Barry eventually does , giving him strength to defeat Laurel . Lyla transfers Borman to another facility and Leo returns to Earth X . Cisco and Wells come up with a plan to boost Wells ' thinking cap . Devoe goes more into his `` god - complex '' ; stating that human emotion is a weakness , causing Marlize to doubt him . 89 20 `` Therefore She Is '' Rob J.
