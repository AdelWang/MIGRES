These individuals could be transgender men or non-binary people who were assigned female at birth (AFAB) but do not identify as women. Despite undergoing a gender transition, some transgender men may retain their reproductive organs and therefore still experience menstrual cycles. However, it's important to note that not all transgender men will menstruate, as some may choose to undergo hormone therapy or surgical procedures that stop menstruation. It's also crucial to approach this subject with sensitivity and respect for the diverse experiences of transgender and non-binary individuals."
